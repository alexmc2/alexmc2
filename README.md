**I'm a Brighton-based software developer currently training on TechNative Digital’s Tech Finishing School (advanced software development).**

I build full-stack web applications with JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node/Express, and PostgreSQL/Supabase. I also have an interest in Linux environments and system architecture and regularly use Python and Bash for scripting.

Adaptable, curious, and always keen to pick up new technologies, I enjoy all aspects of the development process from PostgreSQL to Figma, and I care about creating great user experiences. I'm also currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further develop my understanding of cybersecurity best practices.

With a previous background in accountancy, I am naturally analytical, detail-oriented, and enjoy problem-solving.

My latest project is [CodeShare](https://codeshare.uk), a real-time, browser-based collaborative code editor and whiteboard for pair programming. I created this when I realised that my cohort and I at TechNative Digital needed a frictionless way to quickly view, share, and edit code together.

Building CodeShare was a fantastic learning experience, particularly in real-time network synchronisation, setting up reliable peer-to-peer connections with WebRTC (using TURN for NAT traversal), and keeping user content in sync using Yjs.

I’m currently looking for a junior full-stack developer role in Brighton, London, Cambridge, or remote.
